Network traffic daemon
====

This daemon allows user to sniff packets from particular network interface (or all interfaces).
It can work in two modes - via CLI (Command Line Interface) and as independent daemon in background. Be careful about both modes! If user doesn't stop daemon (using ``make clean`` to remove log files and kill daemon, or ``stop`` command while executing daemon in CLI mode), then it will continue sniffing packets. In future that will lead to memory leaks.

Available options
----

This program uses build automation tool (make). It support following commands:
* **make**, **make all** - process all targets, in our case it's ``main`` and ``daemon``.
* **make main** - process target ``main``. It starts daemon, using command line interface..
* **make daemon** - process target ``daemon``. It starts daemon itself independently in background.
* **make clean** - delete all files, created by running make, including ``log.txt`` and ``IPlog.txt``.
* **make help** - show this message.
